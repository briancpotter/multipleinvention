Arc Lamp,1802,Humphry Davy,Electrical,,,Yes,,"Petrov didn't build a lamp but was also working with carbon arcs ""Humphry Davy is generally credited with the discovery of the arc discharge and the invention of the carbon arc lamp. Indeed, as early  as 1800, he obtained short pulsed arcs with his Voltaic pile. Independently, and earlier than Davy in the sense of continuous discharges, the Russian Vasilii Petrov of St. Petersburg made carbon arcs in 1802. Petrov used a pile of 4200 electrochemical cells to drive what was the most powerful discharge at that time. Petrov’s publication of 1803 appeared only in Russian, and his work was ignored and forgotten for over century. Davy pursued highly successful electrochemical experiments and was unaware of Petrov’s work.""",Tracking Down the Origin of Arc Plasma Science,https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc785757/m2/1/high_res_d/823202.pdf,,,

Jacquard Loom,1804,Joseph-Marie Jacquard,Mechanical,,,,,"No located multiples, though it did Improve on earlier ideas ""An improvement of the draw loom took place in 1725, when Basile Bouchon introduced the principle of applying a perforated band of paper. A continuous roll of paper was punched by hand, in sections, each of which represented one lash or tread, and the length of the roll was determined by the number of shots in each repeat of pattern. The Jacquard machine then evolved from this approach.

Joseph Marie Jacquard saw that a mechanism could be developed for the production of sophisticated patterns. He possibly combined mechanical elements of other inventors, but certainly innovated. His machine was generally similar to Vaucanson's arrangement, but he made use of Jean-Baptiste Falcon's individual pasteboard cards and his square prism (or card ""cylinder""): he is credited with having fully perforated each of its four sides, replacing Vaucanson's perforated ""barrel"". Jacquard's machine contained eight rows of needles and uprights, where Vaucanson had a double row. This modification enabled him to increase the figuring capacity of the machine.

High-pressure steam locomotive,1804,Richard Trevithick,Mechanical,,,Yes,,"There were other efforts to build both steam-powered rail vehicles and high-pressure engines. ""In 1784, William Murdoch, a Scottish inventor, built a small-scale prototype of a steam road locomotive in Birmingham.[14][15] A full-scale rail steam locomotive was proposed by William Reynolds around 1787.[16] An early working model of a steam rail locomotive was designed and constructed by steamboat pioneer John Fitch in the US during 1794.[17] Some sources claim Fitch's model was operable already by the 1780s and that he demonstrated his locomotive to George Washington.[18] His steam locomotive used interior bladed wheels guided by rails or tracks. The model still exists at the Ohio Historical Society Museum in Columbus, US.[19] The authenticity and date of this locomotive is disputed by some experts and a workable steam train would have to await the invention of the high-pressure steam engine by Richard Trevithick, who pioneered the use of steam locomotives.[20] ... Watt's patent prevented others from making high pressure and compound engines. Shortly after Watt's patent expired in 1800, Richard Trevithick and, separately, Oliver Evans in 1801[31][33] introduced engines using high-pressure steam...Evans also began experimenting in this period with steam power and its potential for commercial application. His early ideas culminated in a Delaware state patent application in 1783 for a steam-powered wagon, but it was denied as Evans had yet to produce a working model.""",Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Evans,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine#High-pressure_engines,,

Called Palmipède, it was tested on the Doubs in 1776. In 1783, de Jouffroy built Pyroscaphe, the first paddle steamer, which sailed successfully on the Saône. The first successful trial run of a steamboat in America had been made by inventor John Fitch, on the Delaware River on August 22, 1787.

Safety lamp,1812,William Reid Clanny,Mechanical,,,,Yes,"""Stephenson, the largely self-educated mechanic, arrived at his design of lamp by what has been called “practical empiricism”: a combination of, as David Knight has observed, intuition and common sense, involving a fair amount of trial and error. Davy, on the other hand, the established and well-connected man of science, understood the principle by which his lamp worked: he spent hours experimenting on samples of fire-damp, sent in sealed bottles from the north-east, in the laboratory of the Royal Institution, then used his research findings to shape his design.

Davy and Stephenson had worked independently, and there is no persuasive evidence of any kind of “borrowing” on either side in 1815. Davy had had the benefit of seeing a working example of Clanny’s lamp, but his own “safe lamp” with narrow ventilation tubes was a very different machine to Clanny’s. The improved lamp Davy designed in the final days of December, which replaced the tubes with a wire gauze cylinder enclosing the flame, was, again, a different machine to Stephenson’s.""",The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2015/jul/22/humphry-davy-lamp-controversy-history-science,,,

Electric telegraph,1816,Francis Ronalds,Electrical,,,Yes,,"Lots of efforts here, some deriviative (Wheatsone of Ronalds) but not all. ""While returning by ship from Europe in 1832, Morse encountered Charles Thomas Jackson of Boston, a man who was well schooled in electromagnetism. Witnessing various experiments with Jackson's electromagnet, Morse developed the concept of a single-wire telegraph. He set aside the painting he had been working on, The Gallery of the Louvre.[14] The original Morse telegraph, submitted with his patent application, is part of the collections of the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution.[15] In time, the Morse code that he developed would become the primary language of telegraphy in the world. It is still the standard for rhythmic transmission of data.

Meanwhile, William Cooke and Professor Charles Wheatstone had learned of the Wilhelm Weber and Carl Gauss electromagnetic telegraph in 1833. They had reached the stage of launching a commercial telegraph prior to Morse, despite starting later. ... ""The idea of using electricity to communicate over distance is said to have occurred to Morse during a conversation aboard ship when he was returning from Europe in 1832. Michael Faraday's recently invented electromagnet was much discussed by the ship's passengers, and when Morse came to understand how it worked, he speculated that it might be possible to send a coded message over a wire. While a student at Yale College years before, he had written his parents a letter about how interesting he found the lectures on electricity. Despite what he had learned at Yale, Morse found when he began to develop his idea that he had little real understanding of the nature of electricity, and after sporadic attempts to work with batteries, magnets, and wires, he finally turned for help to a colleague at the University of the City of New York, Leonard D. Gale."" ... ""He complemented his vision with a working telegraph system built in and under his mother's garden at Hammersmith.[19] It was infamously rejected on 5 August 1816 by Sir John Barrow, Secretary at the Admiralty, as being ""wholly unnecessary"".[20] Commercialisation of the telegraph only began two decades later in the UK, led by William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone, who both had links to Ronalds' earlier work.[19][21]"" ... There was also earlier work. ""An early electrical telegraph based on Volta’s cell was proposed by Catalan physician and experimenter Francisco 
Salvá Campillo (1751–1828) in 1804 [5]...Similar results were obtained 
five years later by the electrochemical telegraph developed by the German

hearing of the discovery of Walker's Day-Book), of which I have a photograph, he said, ""My invention, if so it may be called, was introduced by me in Oct. 1829 in entire ignorance of Mr. Walker's.""

friction matches or congreves made their appearance about 1832,"" without even mentioning Walker's prior invention. Now the 'congreves,' which were introduced into England from Germany and Austria in that year, were originally invented by a young French chemist, Charles Sauria of St. Lothair (d. 1895), who in January 1831 (or nearly 
four years after Walker's invention), whilst a student at the College d'Arc, Dole (Jura), made friction matches containing phosphorus, but (like Walker) he did not patent his invention, which some think was pirated in Germany.""",The Centenary of the Friction Match,https://www.nature.com/articles/119495a0,,,

Braile Tactile alphabet,1829,Louis Braille,Other,,,Yes,,"Other efforts at raised writing for the blind, Braille's work was developed from earlier ""night writing"" dot codes. ""One of the first concentrated efforts to create a system of writing occurred in Paris in the 1780s. Valentin Hauy, founder and director of the first school for the blind, produced raised letters on heavy paper using a metal pen with a rounded tip. He also made the observation that printed letters could be seen in reverse through regular paper, and was able to produce reverse metal-cast letters that were able to produce raised letters using wet paper. The first book using the technique of raised or embossed letters was published in 1787 and was, appropriately, an essay on the education of blind children. One of Hauy's objectives was to maintain a close similarity between the way sighted and blind children were educated. His theory was that education of the blind should not deviate significantly from educational tools and technologies used by sighted students.

Hauy's system of producing raised letters on paper underwent a number of modifications, some by Hauy himself, some by others. A blind man in England, Dr. William Moon, created a system of embossed letters that used the regular alphabet, with some of the letters modified or simplified. In the Moon alphabet, eight of the letters remain the same, fourteen have parts left out, and five are completely of new design. Moon's code was, for the time, simple and elegant, and it was used by a relatively wide audience for a substantial period of time.

The precursor to the modern-day standard -- braille -- was the raised dot system created by Charles Barbier, another French citizen. In 1815, Barbier created a system of raised dots, which he theorized (probably correctly!), that raised dots provided a medium that was more easily interpreted tactually (that is, by touch.)

The Brooks, Gates and Burleigh Drill, patented March 6, 1866, was tried in the east heading of the Hoosac in mid-June of that year. Like Couch's tool, this one had a hollow piston, but where Couch's drill was ""thrown"" at the rock face rather like a spear, the Brooks, Gates and Burleigh drill was attached to the piston rod and worked like Fowle's drill. The results were disappointing; it, too, was in the repair shop far too often. Meanwhile, Charles Burleigh purchased Fowle's patent and, abandoning Couch's hollow piston, built a machine in which the drill was attached directly to a rotating piston rod. Steam-powered machine drills had already failed in practical application at the Hoosac, so Burleigh built an air compressor and sprayed water into the cylinders to cool the air during compression.

Although the basic principle is sound, such a craft was unrealizable then and remains so to the present day, since external air pressure would cause the spheres to collapse unless their thickness was such as to make them too heavy to be buoyant.[45] A hypothetical craft constructed using this principle is known as a vacuum airship...A more practical dirigible airship was described by Lieutenant Jean Baptiste Marie Meusnier in a paper entitled ""Mémoire sur l'équilibre des machines aérostatiques"" (Memorandum on the equilibrium of aerostatic machines) presented to the French Academy on 3 December 1783. The 16 water-color drawings published the following year depict a 260-foot-long (79 m) streamlined envelope with internal ballonets that could be used for regulating lift: this was attached to a long carriage that could be used as a boat if the vehicle was forced to land in water. The airship was designed to be driven by three propellers and steered with a sail-like aft rudder. In 1784, Jean-Pierre Blanchard fitted a hand-powered propeller to a balloon, the first recorded means of propulsion carried aloft. In 1785, he crossed the English Channel in a balloon equipped with flapping wings for propulsion and a birdlike tail for steering.[49]...The 19th century saw continued attempts to add methods of propulsion to balloons. Rufus Porter built and flew scale models of his ""Aerial Locomotive"", but never a successful full-size implementation.[50] The Australian William Bland sent designs for his ""Atmotic airship"" to the Great Exhibition held in London in 1851, where a model was displayed. This was an elongated balloon with a steam engine driving twin propellers suspended underneath. The lift of the balloon was estimated as 5 tons and the car with the fuel as weighing 3.5 tons, giving a payload of 1.5 tons.[51][52] Bland believed that the machine could be driven at 80 km/h (50 mph) and could fly from Sydney to London in less than a week.""",Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship#History,,,

Vapour-compression ice machine,1856,James Harrison,Mechanical,Chemical,,,Yes,"""In 1748, the first known artificial refrigeration was demonstrated by William Cullen at the University of Glasgow.[1] Mr. Cullen never used his discovery for any practical purposes. This may be the reason why the history of the icemakers begins with Oliver Evans, an American inventor who designed the first refrigeration machine in 1805. In 1834, Jacob Perkins built the first practical refrigerating machine using ether in a vapor compression cycle. The American inventor, mechanical engineer and physicist received 21 American and 19 English patents (for innovations in steam engines, the printing industry and gun manufacturing among others) and is considered today the father of the refrigerator.[2]

In 1844, an American physician, John Gorrie, built a refrigerator based on Oliver Evans' design to make ice to cool the air for his yellow fever patients.[3] His plans date back to 1842, making him one of the founding fathers of the refrigerator. Unfortunately for John Gorrie, his plans of manufacturing and selling his invention were met with fierce opposition by Frederic Tudor, the Boston “Ice King”. By then, Tudor was shipping ice from the United States to Cuba and was planning to expand his business to India. Fearing that Gorrie’s invention would ruin his business, he began a smear campaign against the inventor. In 1851, John Gorrie was awarded U.S. Patent 8080 for an ice machine.[4] After struggling with Tudor's campaign and the death of his partner, John Gorrie also died, bankrupt and humiliated. His original icemaker plans and the prototype machine are held today at the National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.[5]

In 1853, Alexander Twining was awarded U.S. Patent 10221 for an icemaker. Twining’s experiments led to the development of the first commercial refrigeration system, built in 1856. He also established the first artificial method of producing ice. Just like Perkins before him, James Harrison started experimenting with ether vapor compression. In 1854, James Harrison successfully built a refrigeration machine capable of producing 3,000 kilograms of ice per day and in 1855 he received an icemaker patent in Australia, similar to that of Alexander Twinin""",Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icemaker,,,

At the time of this breakthrough, Schultze was a captain of Prussian artillery. Schultze eventually rose to the rank of colonel. His formulation (dubbed Schultze Powder) was composed of nitrolignose derived from nitrated wood grains, impregnated with saltpetre or barium nitrate.[5][6][7]

In 1882, the Explosive Company of Stowmarket introduced EC Powder, which contained nitro-cotton and nitrates of potassium and barium in a grain gelatinised by ether alcohol. It had coarser grains than other nitrocellulose powders. It proved unsuitable for rifles, but it remained in long use for shotguns[8] and was later used for grenades and fragmentation bombs.[9]

In 1884, the French chemist Paul Vieille produced a smokeless propellant that had some success. It was made out of collodion (nitrocellulose dissolved in ethanol and ether), resulting in a plastic colloidal substance which was rolled into very thin sheets, then dried and cut up into small flakes. It was immediately adopted by the French military for their Mle 1886 infantry rifle and called Poudre B (for poudre blanche, or white powder) to distinguish it from black powder (gunpowder). The rifle and the cartridge developed to use this powder were known generically as the 8mm Lebel, after the officer who developed its 8 mm full metal jacket bullet.[10]

The pedals powered the rear wheel, keeping the rider's feet safely away from the front wheel. The original treadle bicycle model used treadles to transfer power to the rear wheel, while the later 1879 model used a chain drive, an important new technology that had previously only been used on tricycles. Lawson's safety failed to catch on, perhaps because of its increased cost, weight and complexity compared to the penny-farthing.[6] One other variation that appeared at about the same time is the dwarf, exemplified by the Kangaroo, and with a chain-driven front wheel.

By 1885, the safety bicycles cataloged in Henry Sturmey's Indispensable Handbook to the Safety Bicycle included 7 with lever front-drives, 44 with geared front-drives, and only 9 with chain rear-drives.[4][5] In that same year, John Kemp Starley (J.

His lumber business suffered due to his obsession and, like other aviation pioneers, his project attracted mockery. Nevertheless, his wife Melanie supported him. Schwarz proposed aluminium, then a very new material, for construction.

Having worked out the design of an all-metal airship, Schwarz then offered his ideas to the Austro-Hungarian war minister. Some interest was shown, but the government was not ready to provide financial support.

The Russian military attaché, a technically educated man, advised Schwarz to demonstrate his airship in St. Petersburg, where an airship using Schwarz's ideas was built in 1893.[10][11] Schwarz, and later his widow, assumed that test flights would also be made there, but this did not happen.

First self-sustaining gas turbine,1903,Ægidius Elling,Mechanical,Chemical,,Yes,,"""As more steam turbines were being built in the early 20th century, engineers also experimented with gas turbines. Because a gas turbine could use burning gasses directly instead of using them to heat up water first, it was theoretically simpler than a steam turbine. A gas turbine could omit heat exchangers, boilers, cooling towers, and all the other steam-handling equipment that a steam turbine required. This made a gas turbine a compelling proposition, if it could be made to work. In his 1939 retrospective on the early history of gas turbines, Adolf Meyer described them as “the long cherished dream of engineers,” and that “hardly any other kind of machine has received more attention from inventors, skilled and otherwise.” By 1900, there had been hundreds of proposals to build a gas turbine.

As with the steam turbine, the basic ideas behind the gas turbine preceded its construction by many years. Smoke jacks, which used rising smoke and hot air to rotate a fan which turned a spit, date to the 1400s, and in 1791 John Barber patented the design for a gas turbine (though it was never built). But modern gas turbines weren’t built until the early 1900s. In 1903, Rene Armengaud and Charles Lemale built a gas turbine in Paris that successfully generated 220 kilowatts of work. In 1904, F. Stolze built a “hot air engine” in Berlin, which used compressed air that had been heated in a furnace to drive a turbine. And between 1903 and 1907, extensive experiments on gas turbines were performed at General Electric by Sanford Moss (who would spend the rest of his career developing turbochargers for aircraft engines).""",Construction Physics,https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-the-gas-turbine-conquered-the,,,

It was a bat-like design run by a lightweight steam engine of his own invention, with four cylinders developing 20 horsepower (15 kW), driving a four-blade propeller. The engine weighed no more than 4 kilograms per kilowatt (6.6 lb/hp). The wings had a span of 14 m (46 ft). All-up weight was 300 kilograms (660 lb). On 9 October 1890, Ader attempted to fly the Éole. Aviation historians give credit to this effort as a powered take-off and uncontrolled hop of approximately 50 m (160 ft) at a height of approximately 200 mm (7.9 in).[29][30] Ader's two subsequent machines were not documented to have achieved flight.[31]""",Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane#History,,,

First free helicopter flight,1907,Paul Cornu,Mechanical,,,,Yes*,"""In 1904 French scientist and academician Charles Richet built a small, unpiloted
helicopter. While the machine was unsuccessful, one of Richet's students was the
future famous aviation pioneer, Louis Breguet. During the latter part of 1906, the
brothers Louis and Jacques Breguet had begun to conduct helicopter experiments of
their own under the guidance of Professor Richet. The Breguet Brothers were of an
affluent famous clock making family, and were subsequently to become pioneers in
French aviation. Louis Breguet made meticulous tests of airfoil shapes, paralleling
those of the Wright Brothers [see Anderson (1997)], and without a doubt understood
the essential aerodynamic theory of the helicopter. In 1907, the Breguet Brothers
built their first helicopter. Their ungainly quad-rotor Gyroplane No.~1 consisted of four
long girders made of steel tubes and arranged in the form of a horizontal cross. A
rotor consisting of four biplane blades was placed at each of the four corners of the
cross, giving a total of 32 separate lifting surfaces. The pilot sat in the center of the
cross next to a 40-hp engine. The machine is reported to have carried a pilot off the
ground, albeit briefly. Photographs show the assistance of several men stabilizing
and perhaps even lifting the machine. Clearly, the machine never flew completely
freely because, like the Cornu machine, it lacked stability and a proper means of
control. However, the Breguet machine was more sophisticated and probably closer
to achieving proper vertical flight than the machine built about the same time by Paul
Cornu.
In the early 1900s, Igor Ivanovitch Sikorsky and Boris Yur'ev independently began to
design and build vertical-lift machines in Czarist Russia. By 1909, inspired by the
work of Cornu and other French aviators, Sikorsky had built a nonpiloted coaxial

Ramjet concept,1907,Rene Lorin,Mechanical,,Yes,,,"Subsequent descriptions ""Apparently the first person to recognize the possibility of using ram pressure in a propulsive device was Rene Lorin of France, who published an article on the subject in L'Aerophile in May 1913. Lorin did not visualize flight at supersonic speeds and concluded that the efficiency of the engine would necessarily be very poor.Benjamin Charles Carter, an Englishman, in a patent application (l) 2 filed in 1926, presented details of two ramjet-like devices for propelling shells, one with an annular duct and conical nose, the other with a cylindrical duct and normal intake. Carter showed considerable insight into the construction of a ramjet. He noted the problem of flameholding in an air stream of 300 ft/sec and proposed contrastream injection of fuel as a means of atomization and vaporization. He considered operation with combustor pressures of 2 to 6 times atmospheric (Mach 1 to 2) and ambient pressure as low as 5 psia (28,000 ft). Fig. 1 (from the patent application) shows Carter's two configurations. (The nozzle closure shown is detached after boost.) There is no evidence that any tests were made of Carter's invention. e as a prototype of today's ramjets occurs in a German patent (2) applied for in 1928 by Albert Fono of Budapest. Fono describes its use specifically for supersonic flight and furnishes a design for a convergent-divergent inlet (Fig. 2).

In 1903 Kristian Birkeland (1867-1917) at the University of Christiania (Oslo) and Samuel Eyde (1866-1940), the general director of Norsk Hydro in 
Christiania, invented the Birkeland-Eyde electric arc process. Most significantly, 
Fritz Haber (1868-1934) in Karlsruhe was working, like Nernst, on a direct synthesis of ammonia from its elements, and in 1904, two years before Nernst, he 
actually succeeded. But Haber, working with George van Oordt, carried out the 
reaction at atmospheric pressure (P = 1 atm, T = 1020?C, iron catalyst) and 
obtained only a 0.012 percent yield.5

On March 12, 1900, he notified his friend Heinrich von Brunck (1847–1911), General Director of the BASF in Ludwigshafen, that he had succeeded in synthesizing NH3 from its elements in the presence of an iron catalyst at elevated temperature and atmospheric pressure.

Although he never built a working model of the system, variations of Nipkow's spinning-disk ""image rasterizer"" became exceedingly common.[6] Perskyi's paper reviewed the existing electromechanical technologies, mentioning the work of Nipkow and others.[7] However, it was not until 1907 that developments in amplification tube technology, by Lee de Forest and Arthur Korn among others, made the design practical.[8]

Maurice Leblanc
In 1880, French physicist Maurice Leblanc published an article ""Etude sur la transmission électrique des impressions lumineuses"" (""Study on the electric transmission of light impressions"". Amongst various proposals, it included the idea of using oscillating mirrors. This idea will be tested by various inventors, including the Austro-Hungarian Wilhelm von Szygarto (1894), the French Emile Desbeaux (1891), the Polish Jan Szczepanik (1897), the Austrian Bendict Schöffler (1898), the US engineer Alexander McLean Nicolson and the Ungarese Denes von Mihaly.[9]

Rignoux and Fournier
The first demonstration of instantaneous transmission of images was by Georges Rignoux and A. Fournier in Paris in 1909. A matrix of 64 selenium cells, individually wired to a mechanical commutator, served as an electronic retina. In the receiver, a type of Kerr cell modulated the light and a series of variously angled mirrors attached to the edge of a rotating disc scanned the modulated beam onto the display screen. A separate circuit regulated synchronization. The 8×8 pixel resolution in this proof-of-concept demonstration was just sufficient to clearly transmit individual letters of the alphabet. An updated image was transmitted ""several times"" each second.[10]

Rosing
In 1911, Boris Rosing and his student Vladimir Zworykin created a system that used a mechanical mirror-drum scanner to transmit, in Zworykin's words, ""very crude images"" over wires to the ""Braun tube"" (cathode-ray tube or ""CRT"") in the receiver.

""a paper by Noddack (1934) suggesting that the uranium nucleus had broken up. In her paper of 1934 Noddack is critical of Fermi’s limited elimination of elements lighter than uranium, only down to lead. She points out, rightly so, that the old view that radioactive decay forms a series ending in lead or thallium had been ‘‘disproved’’ by the Joliot-Curies’ discovery of artificial radioactivity (Joliot-Curie and Joliot-Curie 1934), andtherefore Fermi should have compared his product with a half-life of 13 min ‘‘with all known elements’’. Noddack (1934) also questions the principle mentioned above that only small changes in the nucleus occurs in nuclear reactions, and states; ‘‘it is conceivable that the nucleus breaks up into several large fragments, which would of course be isotopes of known elements but would not be neighbours of the irradiated element.’’14 Noddack was in fact quite correct, as this is what happens in nuclear fission, but everyone ignored her suggestion.""",The history of the discovery of nuclear fission,,,,
Defibrilator,1939,Naum Gurvich,Electrical,,,Yes,,"""It was the result of efforts by many devoted experts, many of them working in parallel or in competition, that led to the creation of defibrillation as we know it today. While Prevost and Battelli were experimenting with dogs and internal electrodes, another scientist, Louise Robinovitch, very nearly invented both the external pacemaker and the transthoracic defibrillator. Working on cases of respiratory and cardiac arrest due to chloroform poisoning between 1906 and 1909, Robinovitch found that existing methods of resuscitation took too long to set up while the patient was deprived of oxygen [17]. She suggested using electrical current to induce both respiration and heartbeat without opening the chest cavity, and in fact designed a device that could be 
carried by an ambulance and plugged into the household electricity grid. However, as in the case of her predecessors, the work was crippled by the lack of scientific understanding of the mechanism of fibrillation...The Rockefeller Institute funded 
more research on the cause of electrocutions, distributing money to several academic centers and laboratories – including Johns Hopkins University, where physicians Orthello Langworthy and Donald Hooker were working with engineering professor William Kouwenhoven, and accidentally rediscovered defibrillation as well as what would eventually become CPR...Later they found the Prevost and Battelli papers and acknowledged them...Meanwhile, former students of the earlier pioneers were 
continuing their work far from its places of origin. In the United States, Carl Wiggers at Western Reserve University was pursuing the line of investigation he began in his stu ent days under his mentor, W.P. Lombard, who himself had been a student of Carl Ludwig’s. He set out to untangle the basic causes and mechanisms of fibrillation; the research 
paid off. In 1940, Wiggers published a landmark paper, giving for the first time a mechanistic explanation for the induction of ventricular fibrillation, through the concept of the vulnerable period [21]. According to the Wiggers-Wégria model, fibrillation can occur if a second heartbeat is initiated before the natural end of the preceding contraction is reached. This period coincides with the appearance of the 
T-wave on the ECG. A distinctive property of the vulnerable period is such that it responds in the same fashion to stimulation of different sorts: fibrillation may result from artificial stimulation by electricity, or from more “natural” physiological triggers (Fig. 2.6).Wiggers is often credited with resurrecting the line of inquiry into electrical defibrillation, not only because of his scientific breakthrough, but also because of his assiduous efforts to fight institutional reluctance to investigate human 
defibrillation further.",History of Defibrillation,,,,

Unfortunately, his design was not very practical.

N.F. Alekseev and D.D. Malairov developed a successful multicavity magnetron in 1937, but this work wasn't known outside of the Soviet Union until 1940 [PDF].

Ejector seat,1946,James Marti,Mechanical,,,,Yes,"""While several people essentially invented ejection technologies independent of one another, it is widely accepted that the first ejection seat (as they are properly called) was patented in 1916 by a man named Everard Calthrop...It was the Germans who first took to the trend, creating the first production craft to come equipped with an ejection system, the Heinkel 280. Developed in 1940, the turbo-powered jet never went into full production, but the nine of them that were made were outfitted with a seat that would be blown clear of the craft using compressed air. During testing the Heinkel 280’s escape seat even managed to save the life of pilot Helmut Schenk after his instruments froze over. Schenk is now seen as the first person ever to be saved by the use of an ejection seat.

Not long after the Germans started using ejection seats, the trend began to spread. Just a year after the Heinkel debuted, the Swedish SAAB company created an ejector seat technology for one of their planes, and by 1946 the United Kingdom and the United States were working on systems to safely jettison their pilots as well.",The Explosive History of Ejection Seats,https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/07/the-explosive-history-of-ejection-seats-is-a-history-of-innovation-and-close-calls.html,https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/3.57504?journalCode=ja,,

"""Bertie the Brain"" video game",1950,Josef Kates,Electronic,,,,Yes,"""The Nimrod was intended to demonstrate Ferranti's computer design and programming skills rather than to entertain, though Festival attendees were more interested in playing the game than the logic behind it. After its initial exhibition in May, the Nimrod was shown for three weeks in October 1951 at the Berlin Industrial Show before being dismantled.

The game of Nim running on the Nimrod is a candidate for one of the first video games, as it was one of the first computer games to have any sort of visual display of the game. It appeared only four years after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game to use an electronic display, and one year after Bertie the Brain, a computer similar to the Nimrod which played tic-tac-toe at the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition...Bennett's suggestion was supposedly inspired by an earlier Nim-playing machine, ""Nimatron"", which had been displayed in 1940 at the New York World's Fair.[2][3] The Nimatron machine had been designed by Edward Condon and constructed by Westinghouse Electric from electromechanical relays, and had weighed over a ton.[4] Although Bennett's suggestion was a game, his goal was to show off the computer's ability to do mathematical calculations, as Nim is based on mathematical principles, and thus showcase Ferranti's computer design and programming skills rather than to entertain""",Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrod_(computer),,,
Tokamak fusion reactor concept,1950,Igor Tamm and Andrei Sakharov,Other,,Yes,,,"Not Tokamaks but there were lots of fusion proposals: ""Almost as soon as fusion was discovered, people began to think of ways to use it as a power source. The first fusion reaction was produced in a laboratory in 1933 by using a particle accelerator to fire deuterium nuclei at each other, though it fused such a tiny number of them (one out of every 100 million accelerated) that experimenter Ernest Rutherford declared that “anyone who expects a source of power from the transformation of these atoms is talking moonshine.” But just six years later, Oxford physicist Peter Thonemann created a design for a fusion reactor, and in 1947 began performing fusion experiments by creating superheated plasmas contained within a magnetic field. Around this same time another British physicist, G.P. Thomson, had similar ideas for a fusion reactor, and in 1947 two doctoral students, Stan Cousins and Alan Ware, built their own apparatus to study fusion in superheated plasmas based on Thompson’s work. This early British fusion work may have been passed to the Soviets through the work of spies Klaus Fuchs and Bruno Pontecorvo, and by the early 1950s the Soviets had their own fusion power program.""",,https://www.construction-physics.com/p/will-we-ever-get-fusion-power,,,

A system was selected for Western Europe, based on the Netherlands' system for consumer goods and waste transportation called Laadkisten (lit. ""Loading chests""), in use since 1934. This system used roller containers for transport by rail, truck and ship, in various configurations up to 12,100 pounds (5,500 kg) capacity, and up to 10 ft 2 in × 7 ft 6+1⁄2 in × 6 ft 6+3⁄4 in (3.1 m × 2.3 m × 2 m) in size.[15][16] This became the first post World War II European railway standard of the International Union of Railways – UIC-590, known as ""pa-Behälter"". It was implemented in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, West Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and Denmark.[17]

The use of standardized steel shipping containers began during the late 1940s and early 1950s, when commercial shipping operators and the US military started developing such units.[18] In 1948 the U.S. Army Transportation Corps developed the ""Transporter"", a rigid, corrugated steel container, able to carry 9,000 pounds (4,100 kg). It was 8 ft 6 in (2.6 m) long, 6 ft 3 in (1.9 m) wide, and 6 ft 10 in (2.1 m) high, with double doors on one end, was mounted on skids, and had lifting rings on the top four corners.[19] After proving successful in Korea, the Transporter was developed into the Container Express (CONEX) box system in late 1952""",Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_container#History,,,
